Firstly and foremost, you need to install the HOPE Database because some of the activities included in the lectures do require the Hope database although the IBM DB2 has its own as its example. First, download first the dataFile(2).zip and extract it, place it in your C: drive, after placing the folder there #open it -> run the .BAT file# and that should to it and will set all things up on its own.
